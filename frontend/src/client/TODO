This TODO is scoped for the current /client directory.
This directory should contain everything that the frontend needs
    to get data from the backend (models, service to fetch data)

1. Read the models for the data defined in ./models.ts

2. Implement a Snapshot API Client
   - Create a new file (e.g., SnapshotClient.js/ts)
   - Implement a client service that calls the GET /snapshot endpoint.
   - Handle the API response and map it to the defined data models.

3. Implement API Clients for Other Endpoints
   - Develop separate client services for Lobby, Player, and Vote endpoints.
   - Each client should provide functions for the necessary operations (GET, POST, etc.).
   - Map the responses to the appropriate data models and handle errors.

Quick summary of what the expectation could look like:

- api/SnapshotClient.ts
  - Client that calls the GET /snapshot endpoint and returns a Snapshot.

- api/LobbyClient.ts
  - Client for lobby endpoints (e.g., create lobby, get lobby, start lobby).

- api/PlayerClient.ts
  - Client for player endpoints (e.g., add player, get all players, get a single player).

- api/VoteClient.ts
  - Client for vote endpoints (e.g., add vote, get all votes, get a vote).
