Add the color picker for the player. This will require adding a component and using it.

Note:
This should be implemented in the same way and styles as ./components/ClassPicker.tsx
Instead of "options = GameClasses", use the colors defined in /src/constants/player-colors.ts

Implementation steps:
1. Implement the ./components/ColorPicker.tsx and ./components/ColorPicker.module.css files
2. Use the new color picker in ./Home.tsx.
    Make sure to save the selected color and send it to the addPlayer request
