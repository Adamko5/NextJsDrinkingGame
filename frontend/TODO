This is a TODO list for everything the frontend will need,
    in correct order.

This will include:
    1. Other TODO lists for some larger parts of the code
    2. Skeleton of empty files with some description
        of what they should contain
    3. Direct implementation steps or instructions

TODO List:
    1. DONE - Read and implement the TODO list in ./client

    2. DONE - Check the global color scheme and style:
        This is defined in /styles.
        Im going for a blue color profile, your job is to
            fine tune the color or think about the
            technical definition of it.
        My goal is to have "variables" usable for my .css files.

    3. DONE - Read and implement the TODO list in ./components/general

    4. DONE - Read and implement the TODO list in ./app/state

    5. DONE - Read and implement the TODO list in ./app/router

    6. DONE - Read and implement the TODO list in ./app/screens

    7. Implement the final steps to get the app working using Next.js conventions. This means you need to set up the app's entry point according to Next.js standards.

        Implementation steps:
            1. Create a custom _app.tsx file in the pages directory.
                This file should serve as the root component for all pages.
            2. Expose 2 endpoints on the 8081 port:
                /server - should return the Router in the server mode
                /client - should return the Router in the client mode
            3. Wrap the Routers with the SnapshotProvider 
            4. Prepare the "dev" script in package.json to start the Next.js development server
