Assignment summary:
Add container with a background and a bordered div that will surround the component ScreenComponent.

Notes:
The goal for this is to have a consistent look and feel across all screens.
The background could be a light pattern or color, and the bordered div would help focus attention on the content.
Play around with the design. Feel free to add some gradients and other cool functions...


Implementation steps:
1. The screens are to implemented in the empty files in ./screen_containers
    Important note: Use the styles in /src/styles. You can use the general components in /src/components/general.
2. After they are implemented, import them in ./Router.tsx
3. They should encapsulate ScreenComponent in the return.
