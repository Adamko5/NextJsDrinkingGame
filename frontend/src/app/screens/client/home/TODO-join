Add the flow for after the player presses join.

This means there should be:
1. Green "Joined!" text.
2. The displayed player under the text.
    For this, use the component in src/components/specific/DisplayPlayer.tsx
3. Error handling for when the player already exists.
    If the player already exists, the backend will return a Player object with an empty name.
    In this case, the frontend should display a message (maybe even an alert, but ideally a red text under the input),
        which will say that the player name already exists.
        The message should say: "Player (player name) already exists!"
4. Error handling for when the color is already used.
    If the color is already used, the backend will return a Player object with an empty color.
    In this case, the frontend should display a message (maybe even an alert, but ideally a red text under the color picker),
        which will say that the player color is already used.
        The message should say: "Color is already used!"

Note:
You dont have a to make a new component for this.
Just add some state(s) that will differentiate:
    1. Errors (name and color, based on returned object from the backend)
    2. Joined successfully
    3. Some default state that means nothing has happened and player is working on the join form

The implementation is simple, so i will not provide steps.
Implement everything i explained above, however you see fit.
