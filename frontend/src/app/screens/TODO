This TODO is scoped for the current /screens directory.
This directory should contain all the screens of the frontend.
The frontend has 2 parts: server and client.

The implementation of this TODO list consists of pre-made
    file structure and empty files.
Every file contains an explanation of what it represents
    and what it should display.

Implementation steps:
1. Implement the files in ./client - this includes:
    Home screen and it's components in ./client/home
    Voting1 screen and it's components in ./client/voting1
        Note: there might be more types of voting screens,
            so that's why i named it Voting1 instead of Voting
2. Implement the files in ./server - this includes:
    Home screen and it's components in ./server/home
        Note: the Home screen contains some old implementation
            that builds the LAN ip. You can keep that, edit it,
            or even edit the util for the IP in ../../../util/ip-picker, if you need it
    Voting1 screen and it's components in ./server/voting1
3. Add the screens to the router's phaseMap in ../router/phaseMap.tsx

Constraints and notes:
1. You should use the styles defined in ../../styles
2. You can use the general components defined in ../../components/general
