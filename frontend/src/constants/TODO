Make an 'export const' for player colors in the file ./player-colors.ts.
This should be similar to the const of classes in ./classes.ts.
I need a list of 10 distinct colors. Every color will represent 1 player, so make them really distinct.

Notes:
The backend stores a string for each player as their color.
Either define a color by:
    1. It's name (something like Black) and its color representation (000000)
    2. Or straight up save a list of strings like "000000"
    3. Feel free to use your own idea if you have one
