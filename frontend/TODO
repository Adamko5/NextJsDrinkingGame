TODO list:
1. Language toggle! Make 1 file for ALL dialogue. The file will have a sk/eng equivalent. Story.txt will be imported by all. There will be 2 versions: Story_sk.txt and Story_eng.txt. Just copy and rename the correct one.
2. Difficulty selector at the Home page of the server. Adjust backend, so the difficulty can be changed and stored in the Lobby.
3. DIALOGUE image animation isnt happening!!!


Notes and implementation rules:
1. When making a component or a screen, always use:
    The general components defined in src/components/general.
    The styles defined in src/styles. For example, in .css files, use variables like so: var(--xxx).


Refactoring & improvements:
- These are the backlog. This should be completely ignored for the time being.

1. Difficulty scaling = more than HP
Scale puzzle complexity, timer leniency, enemy mechanics (e.g., extra add spawns), and number of correct answers required—not just health bars.
2. /backend/GameProcessor/src/main/resources/TODO
3. AI Trial fairness + guardrails
Filter duplicates, and show a visible “resistance wheel” so players understand why the AI scored a spell well or poorly.
