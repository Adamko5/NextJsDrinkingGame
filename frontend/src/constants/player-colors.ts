// This file defines a palette of distinct colours used to
// represent players throughout the application.  The backend
// stores a colour string for each player so keeping a central
// definition ensures consistency between the frontend and
// backend.

// Each entry provides a humanâ€‘readable name and its
// corresponding hexadecimal colour code (without the leading
// hash).  Colours were chosen to be visually distinct to avoid
// confusion when many players are displayed together.  If you
// adjust these values be sure to maintain sufficient contrast
// against backgrounds and other UI elements.

// colours can be appended as needed but the first ten should
// provide clear differentiation.
