This /general folder should contain general use components—styled
in my app's theme—that can be reused across different screens.

Components to be implemented:
    1. Button:
       - A simple button that accepts a text label.

    2. Clickable Image:
       - An image component that handles click events.

    3. Input:
       - A basic input field for text entry.

    4. Card Component:
       - A container with consistent padding, margin, and subtle shadow.
       - Useful for grouping content in a visually distinct section.

    5. Modal Dialog:
       - A reusable overlay dialog for confirmations, alerts, and temporary interactions.
       - Supports titles, messages, and action buttons.

    6. Toast/Alert Notification:
       - A small popup component for displaying short-lived messages such as successes, warnings, or errors.
       - Configurable to auto-dismiss after a few seconds.

    7. Loader/Spinner:
       - A visual indicator to show when asynchronous operations (e.g., data fetches) are in progress.

    8. Toggle Switch:
       - A binary switch component for enabling or disabling options.
       - Styled to match the app's overall theme.

    10. Icon Component:
        - A standardized component for displaying icons consistently.
        - Supports different sizes and style variants, integrating seamlessly with our theme.

    11. Label Component:
        - A text label to accompany inputs and form elements.
        - Enhances accessibility and maintains layout consistency.

These components will provide a flexible and consistent foundation to build various feature-specific UIs while ensuring the overall appearance adheres to our app's theme.
