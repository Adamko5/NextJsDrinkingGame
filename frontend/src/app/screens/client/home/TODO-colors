Add the color picker for the player. This will require adding a component and using it.

Note:
This should be implemented in the same way, styles and in the same directory as src/app/screens/client/home/components/ClassPicker.tsx.
I created empty ColorPicker.tsx and ColorPicker.module.css files in the directory.
Instead of "options = GameClasses", use the colors defined in /src/constants/player-colors.ts

What it should look like:
    Arrows on the left and right (same as ClassPicker) to toggle the previous/next color option.
    Between the arrows:
        1. A circle with the color as the background
        2. The color's name (defined in player-colors.ts) in the text color of the color, under the circle
        - I assume you will need the column display style.

Implementation steps:
1. Implement the ColorPicker.tsx and ColorPicker.module.css files
2. Use the new color picker in ./Home.tsx.
    Make sure to save the selected color and send it to the addPlayer request
