1. Rework the LobbyManager so it has the lobby code stored
  and can get the Roster data with a simple method call
2. Make the Screen1 into a vote - something like yes/no.
  I want to see that i can manage it this way.
  I need to see how the ws can get the messages and send(?) them
    to the current screen of the server.
  After TODO 1) is implemented, the player's vote should be
    displayer somewhere under him.
