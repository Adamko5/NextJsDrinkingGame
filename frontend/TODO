Implement all TODOs in the project.

1. Make a new generic screen, something that will introduce the story.
2. Transition to the next state - add a button to start the game in the server's home
    This should direct to the story introduction screen.
3. Make a new screen where the players vote for a leader.


Note and implementation rules:
1. When making a component or a screen, always use:
    The general components defined in src/components/general.
    The styles defined in src/styles. For example, in .css files, use var(--bg)

Refactoring & improvements:
- These are the backlog. This should be completely ignored for the time being.
