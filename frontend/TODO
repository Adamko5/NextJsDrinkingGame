This is a TODO list for everything the frontend will need,
    in correct order.

This will include:
    1. Other TODO lists for some larger parts of the code
    2. Skeleton of empty files with some description
        of what they should contain
    3. Direct implementation steps or instructions

TODO List:
    1. DONE - Read and implement the TODO list in ./client

    2. DONE - Check the global color scheme and style:
        This is defined in /styles.
        Im going for a blue color profile, your job is to
            fine tune the color or think about the
            technical definition of it.
        My goal is to have "variables" usable for my .css files.

    3. DONE - Read and implement the TODO list in ./components/general

    4. Read and implement the TODO list in ./app/state

    5. Read and implement the TODO list in ./app/router

    6. Read and implement the TODO list in ./app/screens
