/*
 This file is intentionally left as a placeholder. Next.js expects a
 JavaScript or ESM config file (`next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs`).
 We provide `next.config.mjs` in this project and this `.ts` file should
 be removed to avoid confusing Next's loader.

 Delete this file if you are running the app. It exists only for
 developer convenience while editing TypeScript-based config samples.
