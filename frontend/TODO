TODO list:
1. Implement the todo in src/app/TODO
2. Make a new screen where the players vote for a leader.


Notes and implementation rules:
1. When making a component or a screen, always use:
    The general components defined in src/components/general.
    The styles defined in src/styles. For example, in .css files, use variables like so: var(--xxx).


Refactoring & improvements:
- These are the backlog. This should be completely ignored for the time being.

1. /backend/GameProcessor/src/main/resources/TODO
