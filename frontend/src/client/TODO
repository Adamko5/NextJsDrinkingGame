This TODO is scoped for the current /client directory.
This directory should contain everything that the frontend needs
    to get data from the backend (models, service to fetch data)

1. Define Frontend Data Models
   - Create models for Player, Lobby, Vote, and
     Snapshot that mirror the backend counterparts.
   - Ensure property names and types match those defined
     in the backend.

2. Implement a Snapshot API Client
   - Create a new file (e.g., SnapshotClient.js/ts)
   - Implement a client service that calls the GET /snapshot endpoint.
   - Handle the API response and map it to the defined data models.

3. Implement API Clients for Other Endpoints
   - Develop separate client services for Lobby, Player, and Vote endpoints.
   - Each client should provide functions for the necessary operations (GET, POST, etc.).
   - Map the responses to the appropriate data models and handle errors.

Quick summary of what the expectation could look like:

- models/Player.js/Player.ts
  - Defines the Player data model.

- models/Lobby.js/Lobby.ts
  - Defines the Lobby data model.

- models/Vote.js/Vote.ts
  - Defines the Vote data model.

- models/Snapshot.js/Snapshot.ts
  - Defines the Snapshot data model.

- api/SnapshotClient.js/SnapshotClient.ts
  - Client that calls the GET /snapshot endpoint and returns a Snapshot.

- api/LobbyClient.js/LobbyClient.ts
  - Client for lobby endpoints (e.g., create lobby, get lobby, start lobby).

- api/PlayerClient.js/PlayerClient.ts
  - Client for player endpoints (e.g., add player, get all players, get a single player).

- api/VoteClient.js/VoteClient.ts
  - Client for vote endpoints (e.g., add vote, get all votes, get a vote).
