This /router directory will be used for page routing.

Context:
I have some pages and their unique components defined.
Client and Server pages are different, so they are stored in
    directories ../screens/client and ../screens/server.
I need to implement something that will route the pages based on
    the state that is managed in ../state.

Implementation should contain:
1. Definition of what screens belong to what phases.
    Phases use numbers as ID
    This will be the only place where the screens are
        connected to phase number.
    Every phase number should have corresponding:
        1 server screen and 1 client screen
2. Maybe a single file that reads the state from ../state,
    and routes the correct screen.
    In this step, I need creativity and comparison of multiple approaches.
    Your job is to think about this, analyze this and then implement this.
