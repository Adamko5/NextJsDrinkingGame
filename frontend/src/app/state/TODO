This /state directory will be for fetching and remembering
    the snapshot of the game state.
The idea is, that this will fetch the snapshot using the endpoint
    in ../../client/api and keep it stored in a State
Screen components will then use this state to display everything

Implementation should contain:
1. State of the Snapshot (defined in ../../client/model)
2. Something that runs every X seconds and fetches the latest
    Snapshot State

Everything else should be handled by React.
If my assumption isnt correct, feel free to add any concerns
    (or general thoughts) inside this file below.
