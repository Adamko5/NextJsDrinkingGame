Implement all TODOs in the project.

1. Implement the cookie and playerKey
2. Transition to the next state - add a button to start the game in the server's home
3. Improve the server's home screen design, its too large in height and forces my small notebook's
    monitor to add a scrollbar on the right.


Refactoring & improvements:
- These are the backlog. This should be looked at only after the entire project is done.
